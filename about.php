						Students from all over Kenya have a given set of talents and social
						media is not only providiing the platform but a wide community that largely
						appreciates them. However, most upcomming writers have to find or create a Blogsite
						so as to display their content. This proves hard to some due to lack of
						 hosting or poor maintanance.</br>
						CampusKe was created to give all students and upcomming writers
						a platform to showcase their writing talent. All they have to
						do is sign up link with the admin at <a href="<?php echo BASE_URL . 'contact.php'; ?>">ADMIN</a> by sending
						their sample content and their accounts will be upgraded to
						Authors.</br>
